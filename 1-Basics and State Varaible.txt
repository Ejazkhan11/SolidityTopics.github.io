 Remix IDE ===> Languages support [ solidity, Vyper ]. Written in [ JavaScript ].
                Modules [ Testing, Debugging, Deploy ].



Questions in solidity = 
1- Explain the memory locations in solidity. there are four locations = storage, memory, stack, calldata,
2- what is private variable = this is a varaible they doesn't have a public getter function.



contract bytecode is public in readable form.
contract does not to be public.
bytecode is immutable.
ABI act as a bridge btw applications and smart contract.
ABI and bytecode cannot be generated without source code.



Bytecode say Opcode generate hota hay==> Bytecode to Opcode convert site name( etherscan.io/opcode-tool )

JavaScript VM = Transaction will be executed in a sandbox. own memory blockchain. ideal for testing.
Injected Web3 = Deploy a contract or run a transaction on ethereum main or test network.
Web3 Provider = Connect to a remote node and ethereum client.


State variable ==> 
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0

pragma solidity >= 0.5.0 < 0.9.0;

contract Runs 
{
    uint win;
}

koi b variable jo contract level pe deploy hota hay wo state variable hota hay.yani upar jo lika hay.
ya blockchain may permanently store hota hay.eske lia Gas pay karni pati hay.

state variable may 3 tariko say value enitialize yani desakte ho
1==> [ Initialize the variable at declaration ]
 // SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0

pragma solidity >= 0.5.0 < 0.9.0;

contract Runs 
{
    uint public age=12;
}  




2===> [ Using the contracts constructor ]
  // SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0

pragma solidity >= 0.5.0 < 0.9.0;

contract Runs 
{
    uint public age;

constructor()
{
   age=12;
}

} 




3====>  [ Using the setter function ]
 // SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0

pragma solidity >= 0.5.0 < 0.9.0;

contract Runs 
{
    uint public age;

function setAge() public
{
  age=12;
}

} 




agar ap dusra state variable decalare karna chahte ho tho contract ko pir say compile and deploy karna hoga.
these are permanently stored in contract storage.
Cost gas(expensive).
storage not dynamically allocated(yani jab new variable declare karna hota hay pir esko pir say compile-deploy karna hoga.
